## üìö About This Repository

This repository showcases a series of **end-to-end cloud system projects**, inspired by real-world business challenges.  
Each project demonstrates my ability to design, deploy, automate, monitor, and analyze complete cloud solutions ‚Äî  
aligning with the following roles:

- **Solutions Architect:** Cloud system design, scalability, security, and cost optimization.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), CI/CD automation, observability, and operational excellence.
- **Data Engineer:** Real-time and batch data pipelines for ingestion, processing, and transformation.
- **Data Analyst:** SQL-based analysis and dashboarding for operational insights and business decision support.

My goal is to deliver flexible cloud-native architectures that reflect the depth and range required by modern engineering teams.
